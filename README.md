# Data_Manipulation

### Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

OK, so first, as the name from my repo, it's all about data manipulation by exploiting Pandas package in Python :heart_on_fire:

### Motivation 
When data manipulation and preparation accounts for up to 80% of your work as a data scientist, learning data munging techniques that take raw data to a final product for analysis as efficiently as possible is essential for success.


Data analysis with Python library Pandas makes it easier for you to achieve better results, increase your productivity, spend more time problem-solving and less time data-wrangling, and communicate your insights more effectively.

With Pandas DataFrame, prepare to learn advanced data manipulation, preparation, sorting, blending, and data cleaning approaches to turn chaotic bits of data into a final pre-analysis product. This is exactly why Pandas is the most popular Python library in data science and why data scientists at Google, Facebook, JP Morgan, and nearly every other major company that analyzes data use Pandas.
